                            <p class="subtitle">Software Developer & Problem Solver</p>
                            <p>I'm Cameron Falls, a passionate software developer currently working as a TECDP Lead Analyst - Application Developer at The Cigna Group. I graduated summa cum laude from Missouri University of Science and Technology with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA.</p>
                            <p>My expertise spans multiple programming languages including Python, C++, JavaScript, and SQL, with extensive experience in cloud technologies like AWS, where I hold both Solutions Architect Associate and Cloud Practitioner certifications. I'm particularly passionate about computer vision, machine learning, and automation, having developed algorithms for autonomous drone systems as Chief Software Engineer of the Missouri S&T Multirotor Design Team.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my career at companies like Cigna and Ameren, I've focused on creating innovative solutions that automate complex processes and solve real-world problems. From developing computer vision algorithms to building scalable cloud applications, I enjoy tackling challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.</p>
                            <p>When I'm not coding, I'm continuously learning and sharing my knowledge through personal projects and technical blog posts. I believe in the power of clean code, thoughtful architecture, and the importance of staying current with emerging technologies.</p>

                                    I have used Python for many personal, organizational, and professionsal projects. I utilized Python in my position as an App Development Student Co-op at Ameren for various automation tasks like generating PDF documents and updating databases. Additionally, in my role as a TECDP Senior Analyst at The Cigna Group, I used Python for creating scripts to automate repetitive tasks, including programmatically accessing APIs and tabulating data. As a member of Multirotor Design Team, I used Python for Computer Vision tasks, such as object identification with drones. In addition, I have used Python for projects in classes including Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Game Theory for Computer Science.
