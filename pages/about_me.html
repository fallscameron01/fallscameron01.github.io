                            <p class="subtitle">Software Developer & Problem Solver</p>
                            <p>I am Cameron Falls. I graduated summa cum laude from Missouri University of Science and Technology with a B.S. Computer Science, as well as a Minor in Mathematics. I completed my degree with a 4.0 GPA. I have experience with many programming languages, including Python, C++, JavaScript, and SQL. Some classes I have taken include Computer Networks, Linear Algebra, Algorithms, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. My technical skills include AWS, Git, and Linux development. I obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification in November 2023. I currently work as part of the TECDP program at the Cigna Group, in my current role as a Software Engineer. I have worked at Cigna since July 2023. I worked in multiple roles as a developer at Ameren. From May 2021 to January 2022, I worked full-time as an App Development Student Co-op at Ameren. I continued this role part-time from January 2022 to May 2022. In May 2022, I switched over to work as a full-time Digital Software Intern for the summer. I have also participated in extracuriculars that have given me experience in Computer Science. I was elected as the Chief Software engineer of the Multirotor Design Team, a student design team focussed around autonomous drones, for the 2022-23 school year. My term as the CSE began in August of 2022. As a member of the Computer Vision Team on the Multirotor Design Team, I have developed Computer Vision algorithms to process camera data in order to locate competition objectives. I worked as a Computer Vision Team member from August 2019 to August 2020 and August 2021 to August 2022. I was the Computer Vision Team lead for the team from August 2020 to August 2021. As the Vision Team Lead, I led and mentored members of the computer vision team in order to achieve competition goals.</p>

                                    I have used Python for many personal, organizational, and professionsal projects. I utilized Python in my position as an App Development Student Co-op at Ameren for various automation tasks like generating PDF documents and updating databases. Additionally, in my role as a TECDP Senior Analyst at The Cigna Group, I used Python for creating scripts to automate repetitive tasks, including programmatically accessing APIs and tabulating data. As a member of Multirotor Design Team, I used Python for Computer Vision tasks, such as object identification with drones. In addition, I have used Python for projects in classes including Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Game Theory for Computer Science.
