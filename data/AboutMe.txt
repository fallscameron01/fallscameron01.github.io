I am Cameron Falls. I graduated summa cum laude from Missouri University of Science and Technology with a B.S. Computer Science, as well as a Minor in Mathematics.
I have experience with many programming languages, including Python, C++, and JavaScript.
Some classes I have taken include Computer Networks, Linear Algebra, Algorithms, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
My technical skills include Git and Linux development.
I worked in multiple roles as a developer at Ameren. From May 2021 to January 2022, I worked full-time as an App Development Student Co-op at Ameren.
I continued this role part-time from January 2022 to May 2022. In May 2022, I switched over to work as a full-time Digital Software Intern for the summer.
I have also participated in extracuriculars that have given me experience in Computer Science.
I was elected as the Chief Software engineer of the Multirotor Design Team, a student design team focussed around autonomous drones, for the 2022-23 school year. My term as the CSE began in August of 2022.
As a member of the Computer Vision Team on the Multirotor Design Team, I have developed Computer Vision algorithms to process camera data in order to locate competition objectives.
I worked as a Computer Vision Team member from August 2019 to August 2020 and August 2021 to August 2022. I was the Computer Vision Team lead for the team from August 2020 to August 2021.
As the Vision Team Lead, I led and mentored members of the computer vision team in order to achieve competition goals.
